# angular-tinyCarousel

AngularJS TinyCarousel is a really simple carousel for web apps, written in Angular best approaches way. 
Originally, idea of the module came from jQuery tinyCarousel plugin implementation, that is really cool, 
however can't be used in Angular projects due to different concepts confrontation between jQuery and Angular. 
This module built with idea of reducing DOM manipulation through jQuery and using Angular binding declarative programming approach instead.
